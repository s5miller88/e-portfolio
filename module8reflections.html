									<b>Reflective Portion 1: Literature Review</b>
							
									<p>Our first graded component was to plan and conduct a literature review from a range of available topics. The topic I chose to review was cyberbullying and the tools and approaches being used in the industry. My feelings regarding the topic were forked between the general feelings of the scope and unperceived challenges surrounding the assignment as well as feelings regarding the topic being assessed.
</p>
									<p>In regards to how I felt about the assignment; this was the first literature review I’d undertaken, and I’m relieved I decided to get an early start on it because I was not expecting the amount of time and research that went into building a base of information to actually review. In hindsight, choosing to attempt a systematic review may not have been the best decision as it played havoc on attempting to continue with the topic throughout the research proposal. Ultimately, I felt this was a rewarding project and process and was left proud of the finished product knowing how much time and energy went into finding relevant resources, analyzing them and drawing conclusions from the aggregate relationships between similar bodies of work.</p>
									<p>Had I the opportunity to reattempt this submission, I would have liked to have focused my research question to more specifically analyze machine learning approaches such as those by (Gorro et al., 2018), instead of diverging into two topics where machine learning applications were covered as well as the more social science, culturally focused topics surrounding cyberbullying education and prevention (Bashir Shaikh, Rehman and Amin, 2020). I also would have chosen a different method of literature review since I eventually  found the application of systematic reviews to act largely as self contained pieces that would attempt to create and answer a research question within the confines of the paper as opposed to acting as a foundational assessment of a body of research that could later be used to propose a research question to be answered.</p>
									
									<b>Reflective Portion 2: Research Proposal</b>
									<p>If the literature went well, the research proposal was the opposite. I ironically thought this would be the piece I would have the least trouble with as I generally don’t mind creating and recording slide presentations. I struggled with nearly every step of the process here, partly because of some of the nature of my literature review and its attempt to be a self contained systematic review.</p>
									
									<p>I struggled to develop a research question I felt would be relevant and actually worthy of proposing (verdict is still out on whether it was). When I did decide to continue with demographic analysis of cyberbullying, I had a picture in my mind that I’d gather survey responses and test for data viability, looking into heteroskedasticity of the dataset, as well as comparing different correlation models,such as Spearman Rank Coefficient or Pearson Correlation models to test for relationships, but it all fell apart when I realized the type of data wouldn’t really be valid for any of this analysis. I got too far into the project to restart and was left feeling totally unconfident throughout the entire process, ultimately deciding to just “walk and talk” as if it was completely viable and hoping that carrying out the exercise as more of a “role play” research proposal would be sufficient.</p>
									<p>At the same time, outside of this program, I was involved in a Jira migration to Jira cloud that competed for several of my evenings as well as half a week taken up with a bout of covid. By the end, I ended up submitting the assignment questioning my place in this program and whether I’d be able to produce a viable and relevant research project for my masters dissertation.</p>
									
									<b>Reflective Portion 3: Formative Assessments</b>
									<p>This reflective portion will be shorter as generally speaking, once a graded deliverable was approaching a month to submission deadline, these exercises played second fiddle to the main projects. They largely felt like exercises in time management and I felt the opportunity cost of working on a discussion post relative to performing functions related to the literature review was at times too high.</p>
									<p>I generally try to join the seminar sessions live, but unfortunately this module’s seminar times conflicted with a recurring meeting at work (Canadian time zone) and I was left to listen to the audio recordings. The formative component I most enjoyed was the statistical analysis portion carried out in units eight and nine. These can be found on the artefacts page of the e-portfolio. I’m unsure how I performed on these tasks as I never received feedback on them, but I did enjoy completing them. There were a few moments of deja vu as I used to do a lot of basic statistical analysis in Excel and SPSS in a past role as an economic analyst for a veterinarian association. I enjoyed running through the exercises while drawing conclusions from the findings of various outputs measuring standard deviations, variance and the mean, median and modes. It was a good exercise in showing the power of even basic statistical analysis, where data can be interpreted any number of ways; I found that generally speaking a graphical representation often provided the clearest comparison and clarification of results, but perhaps that speaks to another facet of statistics and how people absorb information. As a visual learner, graphical representation gave me the most context, perhaps others are different.</p>
									<b>Conclusion:</b>
									<p>This module saw many challenges, self-perceived defeats, wins and learning experiences. I found myself routinely challenged by the tasks outlined in the graded portions, especially the research proposal. I found and overcame challenges of managing time relative to professional commitments that competed for limited time as well as unforeseen health curveballs that created a small backlog of tasks. I was fortunate that I started all graded components early, leaving nothing to the last minute and this allowed me to manage the timeline of these tasks.</p>
									
									<p>This module also required balancing expectations of formative assignments relative to graded assignments, attempting to engage with peers through discussion forum posts. While I wouldn’t want to go back in time and go through it all again, reflecting back on the experience, I feel I accomplished something, not only through the work that was carried out, but also the commitment to completing it while working full time. There is achievement and a sense of fulfillment in completing eight hours of work, coming home and continuing with another three to four hours of school. I feel I went through the ringer on this module, but came out better for it.</p>
