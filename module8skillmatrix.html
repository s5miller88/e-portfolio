										<h1>Professional Skills and Skill Growth</h1>
									</header>

									<p>What skills have I learned throughout the RMPP module</p>
									<p>This page differs from the reflective portion of this e-portfolio in that the intention is to focus on more of the hard skills obtained throughout and to briefly review how they might benefit me in future endeavors. Originally this page was intended to hold a professional skills matrix, but on further review the general application of a skills matrix is to compare and contrast the skills of a team instead of an individual.</p>
									<p>This module saw us engage in exercises that are applicable, not only to the outcome of the dissertation component of this program, but also to any role or field where research might be applied. Throughout this module I learned how to conduct (at least on a small scale) a real-world research project, taking into consideration factors such as policy, ethics and statistical integrity. Completing a literature review was foundational in learning many new skills, from the most basic steps such as efficiently sourcing many relevant research articles, to pulling relevant information from those articles selected for review. Furthermore, I learned how to effectively use strings to consistently find appropriate material, where before I often relied on searching and scrolling. This small piece of this course might have the broadest professional impact on my career and how I conduct research assignments.</p>
									<p>This module also taught us to critically examine an issue from multiple angles, looking at problems through the lens of ethics, legality, as well as personal and professional factors. Showcasing the complexity that many real-world situations experience. We can see how situations may appear entirely unethical, but from the standpoint of an organization are still within their legal bounds to act without recourse. Where ethics are concerned, these things rarely occur in a vacuum; complexities and justifications can be made often on multiple sides of an issue. Understanding this is an important facet of career growth as we all will be potential decision makers one day, and in an industry such as cybersecurity, ethics plays a critical role in establishing professional integrity.</p>
